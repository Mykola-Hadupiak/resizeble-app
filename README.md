# [RESIZEBLE](https://mykola-hadupiak.github.io/resizeble-app/)  

Before use, you need to download the server from github or run it from the zip file that I transferred (documentation on enabling the server is in it).

The application is made in react with SASS and I also used the re-resizable library here to make the resizing logic.

You can also add some text that will be saved in the database and after that you can change it.

To start this project use npm start.
